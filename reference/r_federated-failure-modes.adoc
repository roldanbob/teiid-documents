{{ book.productnameFull }} provides the capability to obtain _partial results_ in the event of data source unavailability or failure. 
This is especially useful when unioning information from multiple sources, or when doing a left outer join, 
where you are appending columns to a master record, but still want the record if the extra information is not available.

A source is considered to be unavailable if the connection factory that is associated with the source generates an exception in response to a query. 
The exception will be propagated to the query processor, where it will become a warning on the statement. 
For more information about partial results and SQLWarning objects, see _Partial Results Mode_ in the Client Developer's Guide.
