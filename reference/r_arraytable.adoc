= ARRAYTABLE

The ARRAYTABLE function processes an array input to produce tabular output. 
The function itself defines what columns it projects. 
The ARRAYTABLE function is implicitly a nested table and can be used within FROM clauses.

.Usage

[source,sql]
----
ARRAYTABLE([ROW|ROWS] expression COLUMNS <COLUMN>, ...) AS name
COLUMN := name datatype
----

.Parameters

expression:: The array to process, which should be a java.sql.Array or java array value.
ROW|ROWS:: If ROW (the default) is specified, then only a single row is produced from the given array (typically a one dimensional array). 
If ROWS is specified, then multiple rows are produced. 
A multidimensional array is expected, and one row is produced for every non-null element of the outer array.

If the expression is null, no rows are produced.

.Syntax rules

* Columns names cannot contain duplicates.

.Array table examples

* As a nested table:

[source,sql]
----
select x.* from (call source.invokeMDX('some query')) r, arraytable(r.tuple COLUMNS first string, second bigdecimal) x
----

ARRAYTABLE is effectively a shortcut for using the `array_get` function in a nested table. 

For example, the following ARRAYTABLE function:

[source,sql]
----
ARRAYTABLE(val COLUMNS col1 string, col2 integer) AS X
----

is the same as the following statement which uses an `array_get` function:

[source,sql]
----
TABLE(SELECT cast(array_get(val, 1) AS string) AS col1, cast(array_get(val, 2) AS integer) AS col2) AS X
----
