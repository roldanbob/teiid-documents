= Raise statement

A `RAISE` statement is used to raise an exception or warning. 
When raising an exception, this statement will also roll back the current transaction, if one exists.

.Usage

[source,sql]
----
RAISE [SQLWARNING] exception;
----

Where exception may be a variable reference to an exception or an exception expression.

.Syntax rules

* If `SQLWARNING` is specified, the exception will be sent to the client as a warning and the procedure will continue to execute.
* A null warning will be ignored. 
A null non-warning exception will still cause an exception to be raised.

[source,sql]
.*Example raise statement*
----
RAISE SQLWARNING SQLEXCEPTION 'invalid' SQLSTATE '05000';
