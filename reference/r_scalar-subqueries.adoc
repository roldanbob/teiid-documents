= Scalar subqueries

Subqueries can be used to produce a single scalar value in the SELECT, WHERE, or HAVING clauses only. 
A scalar subquery must have a single column in the SELECT clause and should return either 0 or 1 row. 
If no rows are returned, null will be returned as the scalar subquery value. For information about other types of subqueries, 
see xref:subqueries[Subqueries].
