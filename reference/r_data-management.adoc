.Cursoring and batching
{{ book.productnameFull }} cursors all results, regardless of whether they are from one source 
or many sources, and regardless of what type of processing (joins, unions, and so forth.) 
have been performed on the results.

{{ book.productnameFull }} processes results in batches. A batch is simply a set of records. 
The number of rows in a batch is determined by the buffer system property _processor-batch-size_ 
and is scaled upon the estimated memory footprint of the batch.

Client applications have no direct knowledge of batches or batch sizes, but rather 
specify fetch size. However the first batch, regardless of fetch size is always proactively 
returned to synchronous clients. Subsequent batches are returned based on client demand for the data. 
Pre-fetching is utilized at both the client and connector levels.

.Buffer management
The buffer manager manages memory for all result sets used in the query engine. 
That includes result sets read from a connection factory, result sets used temporarily 
during processing, and result sets prepared for a user. Each result set is referred to 
in the buffer manager as a tuple source.

When retrieving batches from the buffer manager, the size of a batch in bytes is estimated 
and then allocated against the max limit.

.Memory management
The buffer manager has two storage managers - a memory manager and a disk manager. The buffer 
manager maintains the state of all the batches, and determines when batches must be moved from memory to disk.

.Disk management
Each tuple source has a dedicated file (named by the ID) on disk. This file will be created 
only if at least one batch for the tuple source had to be swapped to disk. The file is random access. 
The processor batch size property defines how many rows should nominally exist in a batch 
assuming 2048 bits worth of data in a row. If the row is larger or smaller than that target, 
the engine will adjust the batch size for those tuples accordingly. Batches are always read 
and written from the storage manager whole.

The disk storage manager caps the maximum number of open files to prevent running 
out of file handles. In cases with heavy buffering, this can cause wait times while waiting 
for a file handle to become available (the default maximum open files is 64).

.Cleanup
When a tuple source is no longer needed, it is removed from the buffer manager. The buffer 
manager will remove it from both the memory storage manager and the disk storage manager. 
The disk storage manager will delete the file. In addition, every tuple source is tagged 
with a "group name" which is typically the session ID of the client. When the clientâ€™s session 
is terminated (by closing the connection, server detecting client shutdown, or administrative termination), 
a call is sent to the buffer manager to remove all tuple sources for the session.

In addition, when the query engine is shutdown, the buffer manager is shut down, which 
will remove all state from the disk storage manager and cause all files to be closed. 
When the query engine is stopped, it is safe to delete any files in the buffer directory 
as they are not used across query engine restarts and must be due to a system crash 
where buffer files were not cleaned up.
