= SELECT command

The SELECT command is used to retrieve records for any number of relations.

A SELECT command can contain the following clauses:

* xref:with-clause[WITH …]
* xref:select-clause[SELECT …]
* xref:from-clause[FROM …]
* xref:where-clause[WHERE …]
* xref:group-by-clause[GROUP BY …]
* xref:having-clause[HAVING …]
* xref:order-by-clause[ORDER BY …]
* xref:limit-clause[(LIMIT …)] | ([OFFSET …] [FETCH …])
* xref:option-clause[OPTION …]

Except for the OPTION clause, all of the preceding clauses are defined by the SQL specification. 
The specification also specifies the order in which these clauses are logically processed. 
Processing occurs in stages, with each stage passing a set of rows to the following stage.
The processing model is logical, and does not represent the way that a database engine performs the processing, 
but it is a useful model for understanding how SQL works.
The SELECT command processes clauses in the following stages:

Stage 1: WITH clause:: Gathers all rows from all with items in the order listed. 
Subsequent WITH items and the main query can reference a WITH item as if it were a table.
Stage 2: FROM clause:: Gathers all rows from all tables involved in the query and logically joins them with a Cartesian product 
to produce a single large table with all columns from all tables. 
Joins and join criteria are then applied to filter rows that do not match the join structure.
Stage 3: WHERE clause:: Applies a criteria to every output row from the FROM stage, further reducing the number of rows.
Stage 4: GROUP BY clause:: Groups sets of rows with matching values in the GROUP BY columns.
Stage 5: HAVING clause:: Applies criteria to each group of rows. 
Criteria can only be applied to columns that will have constant values within a group 
(those in the grouping columns or aggregate functions applied across the group).
Stage 6: SELECT clause:: Specifies the column expressions that should be returned from the query. 
Expressions are evaluated, including aggregate functions that are based on the groups of rows, 
which will no longer exist after this point. 
The output columns are named using either column aliases or an implicit name determined by the engine. 
If SELECT DISTINCT is specified, duplicate removal is performed on the rows being returned from the SELECT stage.
Stage 7: ORDER BY clause:: Sorts the rows returned from the SELECT stage as desired. 
Supports sorting on multiple columns in specified order, ascending or descending. 
The output columns will be identical to those columns returned from the SELECT stage and will have the same name.
Stage 8: LIMIT clause:: Returns only the specified rows (with skip and limit values). 

The preceding model helps to understand how SQL works. 
For example, given that the SELECT clause assigns aliases to columns, 
it makes sense that the subsequent ORDER BY clause must use those aliases to reference columns. 
Without knowledge of the processing model, this can be somewhat confusing. 
Seen in light of the model, it is clear that the ORDER BY stage is the only stage occurring after the SELECT stage, which is where the columns are named. 
Because the WHERE clause is processed before the SELECT, the columns have not yet been named and the aliases are not yet known.

TIP: The explicit table syntax `TABLE x` may be used as a shortcut for `SELECT * FROM x`.
