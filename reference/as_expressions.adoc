= Expressions

Identifiers, literals, and functions can be combined into expressions. Expressions can 
be used in a query with nearly any keyword, including SELECT, FROM (if specifying join criteria), WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, or ORDER BY.

{{ book.productnameFull }} supports the following types of expressions:

* xref:column-identifiers[Column identifiers]
* xref:literals[Literals]
* xref:aggregate-functions[Aggregate functions]
* xref:window-functions[Window functions]
* xref:case-and-searched-case-experssions[Case and searched case]
* xref:scalar-subqueries[Scalar subqueries]
* xref:parameter-references[Parameter references]
* xref:arrays[Arrays]
* xref:criteria[Criteria]
* xref:scalar-functions[Scalar functions]
