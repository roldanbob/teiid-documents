= Command statement

A command statement executes a DML command, DDL command, or dynamic SQL against one or more data sources.
For more information, see xref:dml-commands[DML commands] and xref:ddl-commands[DDL commands].
 
.Usage

[source,sql]
----
command [(WITH|WITHOUT) RETURN];
----

[source,sql]
.*Example command statements*
----
SELECT * FROM MySchema.MyTable WHERE ColA > 100 WITHOUT RETURN;
INSERT INTO MySchema.MyTable (ColA,ColB) VALUES (50, 'hi');
----

.Syntax rules

* EXECUTE command statements may access IN/OUT, OUT, and RETURN parameters. 
To access the return value the statement will have the form `var = EXEC proc...`. 
To access OUT or IN/OUT values named parameter syntax must be used. 
For example, `EXEC proc(in_param=>'1', out_param=>var)` will assign the value of the out parameter to the variable var. 
It is expected that the datatype of a parameter is implicitly convertible to the data type of the variable.
For more information about EXECUTE command statements, see xref:execute-command[EXECUTE command].

* The RETURN clause determines if the result of the command is returnable from the procedure. 
WITH RETURN is the default. 
If the command does not return a result set, or the procedure does not return a result set, the RETURN clause is ignored. 
If WITH RETURN is specified, the result set of the command must match the expected result set of the procedure. 
Only the last successfully executed statement executed WITH RETURN will be returned as the procedure result set. 
If there are no returnable result sets and the procedure declares that a result set will be returned, then an empty result set is returned.

[NOTE]
====
The INTO clause is used only for inserting into a table.  
`SELECT ... INTO table ...`` is functionally equivalent to `INSERT INTO table SELECT ...`` 
If you need to assign variables, you can use one of the following methods:

Use an assignment statement with a scalar subquery::

[source,sql]
----
DECLARE string var = (SELECT col ...);
----

Use a temporary table::

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO #temp SELECT col1, col2 ...;
DECLARE string VARIABLES.RESULT = (SELECT x FROM #temp);
----

Use an array::

[source,sql]
----
DECLARE string[] var = (SELECT (col1, col2) ...);
DECLARE string col1val = var[1];
