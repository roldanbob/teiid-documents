= Special variables

`VARIABLES.ROWCOUNT` integer variable will contain the numbers of rows affected by the last INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE command statement executed. 
Inserts that are processed by dynamic SQL with an `into` clause will also update the `ROWCOUNT`.

.Usage

[source,sql]
.*Sample usage*
----
...
UPDATE FOO SET X = 1 WHERE Y = 2;
DECLARE INTEGER UPDATED = VARIABLES.ROWCOUNT;
...
----

Non-update command statements (`WITH` or `WITHOUT RETURN`) will reset the `ROWCOUNT` to 0.

NOTE: To ensure you are getting the appropriate `ROWCOUNT` value, save the `ROWCOUNT` to a variable immediately after the command statement.
