If you are using the default native metadata import, or the {{ book.productnameFull }} connection importer, 
the importer defaults to `importKeys=false` and `excludeTables=.*[.]MSys.*` to avoid issues with the metadata provided by the JDBC ODBC bridge. 
You might need to adjust these values if you use a different JDBC driver.

ucanaccess:: The Microsoft Access translator known by the type name *_ucanaccess_* is for use with Microsoft Access 2003 
or later via the http://ucanaccess.sourceforge.net/site.html[UCanAccess driver].
