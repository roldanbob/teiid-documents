= Role mapping

Each {{ book.productnameFull }} data role can be mapped to any number of container roles or to any authenticated user. 

{% if book.targetWildfly %}
You may control role membership through whatever system the {{ book.productnameFull }} security domain login modules are associated with. 
The kit includes example files for use with the UsersRolesLoginModule - see teiid-security-roles.properties.

If you have an alternative security domain that a VDB should use, then set the VDB property security-domain to the relevant security domain.
{% endif %}

It is possible for a user to have any number of container roles, which in turn imply a subset of {{ book.productnameFull }} data roles. 
Each applicable {{ book.productnameFull }} data role contributes cumulatively to the permissions of the user. 
No one role supersedes or negates the permissions of the other data roles.
