= Declaration statement

A declaration statement declares a variable and its type. 
After you declare a variable, you can use it in that block within the procedure and any sub-blocks. 
A variable is initialized to null by default, but can also be assigned the value of an expression as part of the declaration statement.

.Usage

[source,sql]
----
DECLARE <type> [VARIABLES.]<name> [= <expression>];
----

[source,sql]
.*Example syntax*
----
  declare integer x;
  declare string VARIABLES.myvar = 'value';
----

.Syntax rules

* You cannot redeclare a variable with a duplicate name in a sub-block.
* The VARIABLES group is always implied even if it is not specified.
* The assignment value follows the same rules as for an Assignment statement.
* In addition to the standard types, you may specify EXCEPTION if declaring an exception variable.
