= SELECT clause

SQL queries start with the SELECT keyword and are often referred to as "SELECT statements". 
{{ book.productnameFull }} supports most of the standard SQL query constructs.

.Usage

[source,sql]
----
SELECT [DISTINCT|ALL] ((expression [[AS] name])|(group identifier.STAR))*|STAR ...

.Syntax Rules

* Aliased expressions are only used as the output column names and in the ORDER BY clause. 
They cannot be used in other clauses of the query.
* DISTINCT may only be specified if the SELECT symbols are comparable.
