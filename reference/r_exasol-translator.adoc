= Exasol translator (exasol)

Also see common xref:jdbc-translators[JDBC Translators] information.

The Exasol translator, known by the type name *_exasol_*, is for use with Exasol version 6 or later.

.Usage
The Exasol database has the NULL HIGH default ordering, whereas the {{ book.productnameFull }} engine works in the NULL LOW mode.
As a result, depending on whether the ordering is pushed down to Exasol or done by the engine, you might observe NULLs at either the beginning or end of returned results. 
To enforce consistency, you can run {{ book.productnameFull }} with `org.teiid.pushdownDefaultNullOrder=true` to specify NULL LOW ordering. 
Enforcing NULL LOW ordering can result in decreased performance.
