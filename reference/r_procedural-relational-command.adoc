= Procedural relational command

Procedural relational commands use the syntax of a SELECT to emulate an EXEC. 
In a procedural relational command, a procedure group name is used in a FROM clause in place of a table. 
That procedure is executed in place of a normal table access if all of the necessary input values 
can be found in criteria against the procedure. 
Each combination of input values that is found in the criteria results in the execution of the procedure.

.Example syntax

[source,sql]
----
select * from proc
----

[source,sql]
----
select output_param1, output_param2 from proc where input_param1 = 'x'
----

[source,sql]
----
select output_param1, output_param2 from proc, table where input_param1 = table.col1 and input_param2 = table.col2
----

.Syntax rules
* The procedure as a table projects the same columns as an EXEC with the addition of the input parameters. 
For procedures that do not return a result set, IN_OUT columns are projected as two columns: 
** One to represents the output value.
** One with the name {column name}_IN that represents the input of the parameter.
* Input values are passed via criteria. 
Values can be passed by `=`, `is null`, or as `in` predicates. 
Disjuncts are not allowed. 
It is also not possible to pass the value of a non-comparable column through an equality predicate.
* The procedure view automatically has an access pattern on its IN and IN_OUT parameters.
The access pattern allows the procedure view to be planned correctly as a dependent join when necessary, 
or to fail when sufficient criteria cannot be found.
* Procedures that contain duplicate names between the parameters (IN, IN_OUT, OUT, RETURN) and the result 
set columns cannot be used in a procedural relational command.
* If there is already a table or view with the same name as the procedure, then it cannot be invoked via procedural relational syntax.
* Default values for IN or IN_OUT parameters are not used if there is no criteria present for a given input. 
Default values are only valid for named procedure syntax. For more information, see xref:execute-command[EXECUTE].

NOTE: The preceding issues do not apply when you use a nested table reference. 
For more information, see _Nested table reference_ in xref:from-clause[FROM clause].

.Multiple execution
The use of `in` or join criteria can result in a procedure being executed multiple times.
