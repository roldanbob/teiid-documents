= Subquery optimization

* EXISTS subqueries are typically rewrite to "SELECT 1 FROM â€¦" to prevent unnecessary evaluation of SELECT expressions.
* Quantified compare SOME subqueries are always turned into an equivalent IN predicate or comparison against an 
aggregate value. e.g. col > SOME (select col1 from table) would become col > (select min(col1) from table)
* Uncorrelated EXISTs and scalar subquery that are not pushed to the source can be pre-evaluated prior to source command formation.
* Correlated subqueries used in DETELEs or UPDATEs that are not pushed as part of the corresponding DELETE/UPDATE 
will cause {{ book.productnameFull }} to perform row-by-row compensating processing. 
* The merge join (MJ) hint directs the optimizer to use a traditional, semijoin, or antisemijoin merge join if possible. 
The dependent join (DJ) is the same as the MJ hint, but additionally directs the optimizer to use the subquery as the independent side of a dependent join if possible. 
This will only happen if the affected table has a primary key. If it does not, then an exception will be thrown.
* WHERE or HAVING clause IN, Quantified Comparison, Scalar Subquery Compare, and EXISTs predicates can take the 
MJ, DJ, or NO_UNNEST (no unnest) hints appearing just before the subquery.
The NO_UNNEST hint, which supersedes the other hints, will direct the optimizer to leave the subquery in place.
* SELECT scalar subqueries can take the MJ or NO_UNNEST hints appearing just before the subquery. 
The MJ hint directs the optimizer to use a traditional or semijoin merge join if possible. 
The NO_UNNEST hint, which supersedes the other hints, will direct the optimizer to leave the subquery in place.

* The system property `org.teiid.subqueryUnnestDefault` controls whether the optimizer will by default unnest subqueries during rewrite. 
If `true`, then most non-negated WHERE or HAVING clause EXISTS or IN subquery predicates can be converted to a traditional join.
* The planner will always convert to antijoin or semijoin variants if costing is favorable. Use a hint to override this behavior needed.
* EXISTs and scalar subqueries that are not pushed down, and not converted to merge joins, are implicitly limited to 1 and 2 result rows respectively via a limit.
* Conversion of subquery predicates to nested loop joins is not yet available.
