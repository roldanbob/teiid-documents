= Connecting to a {{ book.productnameFull }} Server

The {{ book.productnameFull }} JDBC API provides Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) access to a Virtual Database (VDB) deployed on {{ book.productnameFull }}. The {{ book.productnameFull }} JDBC API is compatible with the JDBC 4.0 specification; however, it is not compatible with some methods. You cannot use some advanced features, such as updatable result sets or SQL3 data types.

Java client applications connecting to a {{ book.productnameFull }} Server will need to use at least the Java 1.8 JDK. Earlier versions of Java are not compatible.  You may attempt to use a client driver from earlier Teiid versions that were compatible with the target JRE.

{% if book.targetWildfly %}
Support for {{ book.productnameFull }} clients and servers older than version 8 has been dropped from {{ book.productnameFull }} 10.2 and later.

Before you can connect to the {{ book.productnameFull }} Server using the {{ book.productnameFull }} JDBC API, please do following tasks.

1.  Install the {{ book.productnameFull }} Server. See the "Admin Guide" for instructions.
2.  Build a Virtual Database (VDB). Check the "Reference Guide" for instructions on how to build a VDB. If you do not know what VDB is, then start with this http://www.jboss.org/teiid/basics/virtualdatabases.html[document].
3.  Deploy the VDB into {{ book.productnameFull }} Server. Check link:../admin/Administrators_Guide.adoc[Administrator’s Guide] for instructions.
4.  Start the {{ book.productnameFull }} Server ({{ book.asName }}), if it is not already running.
{% endif %}

Once you have the VDB deployed in {{ book.productnameFull }}, client applications can connect to the {{ book.productnameFull }} Server and issue SQL queries against deployed VDB using JDBC API. If you are new to JDBC, see Java’s documentation about http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/index.html[JDBC]. {{ book.productnameFull }} ships with teiid-{{ book.fullVersionNumber }}-jdbc.jar that can be found in the http://teiid.io/teiid_runtimes/teiid_wildfly/downloads/[downloads].

You can also obtain the {{ book.productnameFull }} JDBC from the Maven Repository https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/ using the coordinates:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.teiid</groupId>
  <artifactId>teiid</artifactId>
  <classifier>jdbc</classifier>
  <version>{{ book.fullVersionNumber }}</version>
</dependency>
----

Important classes in the client JAR:

* `org.teiid.jdbc.TeiidDriver`- allows JDBC connections using the {{ book.javaVersionUrl }}/docs/api/java.sql/java/sql/DriverManager.html[DriverManager] class.
* `org.teiid.jdbc.TeiidDatasource`- allows JDBC connections using the {{ book.javaVersionUrl }}/docs/api/java.sql/javax/sql/DataSource.html[DataSource] {{ book.javaVersionUrl }}/docs/api/java.sql/javax/sql/XADataSource.html[XADataSource] class. You should use this class to create managed or XA connections.

Once you have established a connection with the {{ book.productnameFull }} Server, you can use standard JDBC API classes to interrogate metadata and execute queries.

[id="client-dev-Connecting_to_a_Teiid_Server-OpenTracing-Support"]
== OpenTracing compatibility

http://opentracing.io/[OpenTracing] is optional for the client driver.  For remote connections to propagate the span the driver must have the appropriate OpenTracing jars in its classpath.  This can be done via a maven dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.opentracing</groupId>
    <artifactId>opentracing-util</artifactId>
    <version>${version.opentracing}</version>
</dependency>
----

where version.opentracing (0.31 for {{ book.productnameFull }} 11.0) is defined in the project integration bom.  

Or you may manually include the opentracing-util, opentracing-api, and opentracing-noop jars as needed by the tooling or other environment where the {{ book.productnameFull }} client jar is utilized.

OpenTracing support in the client and server requires that the respective runtimes have an appropriate tracing client installed and available via the GlobalTracer.
