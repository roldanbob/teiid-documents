= DSN Less Connection

You can also connect to {{ book.productnameFull }} VDB using ODBC with out explicitly creating a DSN. However, in these scenarios your application needs, what is called as "DSN less connection string". The below is a sample connection string

For Windows:

----
ODBC;DRIVER={PostgreSQL Unicode};DATABASE=<vdb-name>;SERVER=<host-name>;PORT=<port>;Uid=<username>;Pwd=<password>;c4=0;c8=1;            
----

For *nix:

----
ODBC;DRIVER={PostgreSQL};DATABASE=<vdb-name>;SERVER=<host-name>;PORT=<port>;Uid=<username>;Pwd=<password>;c4=0;c8=1;            
----

See the available xref:client-dev-ODBC_Support--bookproductnameFull-Connection-Settings[{{ book.productnameFull }} ODBC connection settings].
