= GeoServer Integration

link:http://geoserver.org/[GeoServer] is an open source server for geospatial data.  It can be integrated with {{ book.productnameFull }} to serve geospatial data from a variety of sources.

[id="client-dev-GeoServer_Integration-Prerequisites"]
== Prerequisites

- Have GeoServer installed. {% if book.targetWildfly %} By default this will be in a different container than the {{ book.productnameFull }} WildFly instance, but it should be possible to
deploy into the same WildFly instance. {% endif %}  {{ book.productnameFull }} integration was initially tested with GeoServer version 2.6.x, and is compatible with versions 2.8.x and 2.12.x. See link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TEIID-5236[TEIID-5236] 

- Your {{ book.productnameFull }} installation should already be setup for pg/ODBC access.  This allows the built-in compatibility with GeoServer for PostGIS/PostgreSQL to be used.

- Have a VDB deployed that exposes one or more tables containing an appropriate Geometry column.
.. The {{ book.productnameFull }} system table link:../reference/sys_schema.adoc[GEOMETY_COLUMNS] will be used by GeoServer.  Please ensure that the relevant 
geometry columns have the appropriate srid and coord_dimensions, which may require setting the {http://www.teiid.org/translator/spatial/2015}srid and {http://www.teiid.org/translator/spatial/2015}coord_dimension
extension property on the geometry column. 

[id="client-dev-GeoServer_Integration-GeoServer-Configuration"]
== GeoServer Configuration

This process will need to be repeated for each VDB schema you are exposing that contains geospatial data.

. Using the GeoServer admin web application, select Stores -> Add new Store. Under Vector Data Sources, select PostGIS. 
. Using the non-JNDI connection, fill in the {{ book.productnameFull }} server host, ODBC port, database (VDB Name with optional version), user, and password, 
schema (schema/model from the target VDB).
.. If your VDBs contain target schema or table names with % or _, {{ book.productnameFull }} must be configured to use the same default like escape 
character '\' as PostgreSQL to properly respond to metadata queries.  Either the link:../admin/System_Properties.adoc[system property] 
org.teiid.backslashDefaultMatchEscape must be set to true or the {{ book.productnameFull }} session variable backslashDefaultMatchEscape must be set to true -  
for example enter "select cast(teiid_session_set('backslashDefaultMatchEscape', true) as boolean)" in the "Session startup SQL" to
configure just this GeoServer connection pool.
. Follow the typical GeoServer instructions for creating a Layer based upon the {{ book.productnameFull }} store.
.. Note that {{ book.productnameFull }} is not compatible with the PostGIS function ST_Estimated_Extent and attempts to compute the bounding box from the data, 
 result in log errors.

[id="client-dev-GeoServer_Integration-Additional-Considerations"]
== Additional Considerations

- If you are integrating a PostgreSQL source, you must not re-expose the geometry_columns or geography_columns tables.
This is because GeoServer makes unqualified queries that reference geometry_columns and the query should resolve against the {{ book.productnameFull }} system table instead.
- {{ book.productnameFull }} does not by default expose a GT_PK_METADATA, which is optionally used by GeoServer
