= Configuring Connection Properties with ODBC

When working with ODBC connections, you can set the xref:client-dev-Driver_Connection-URL-Connection-Properties[URL connection properties] 
that are available in {{ book.productnameFull }} by running a command such as the following:

----
SET <property-name> TO <property-value>
----  

For example, to turn on result set caching you can run the following command:

----
SET resultSetCacheMode TO 'true'
----

Another option is to use VDB properties in the vdb file to configure the connection, as in 
the following example: 

[source,sql]
----
CREATE DATABASE vdb OPTIONS ("connection.partialResultsMode" true);
----

{% if book.targetWildfly %}
Or in an XML VDB:
----
<vdb name="...">
    <property name="connection.resultSetCacheMode" value="true"/>
    ...
</vdb>
----
{% endif %}
