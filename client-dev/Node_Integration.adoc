= Node.js Integration

link:https://nodejs.org[Node.js] is an open source event driven runtime that can be integrated with {{ book.productnameFull }}.

[id="client-dev-Node_Integration-Prerequisites"]
== Prerequisites

- Have Node.js installed.  The npm pagckage pg is also required.  Use "

- Your {{ book.productnameFull }} installation should already be setup for link:../admin/Socket_Transports.adoc[ODBC] access.  This allows the optional compatibility with Node.js 
for PostGIS/PostgreSQL to be used.

[id="client-dev-Node_Integration-Usage"]
== Usage

For example if you have VDB called "northwind" deployed on your {{ book.productnameFull }} server, and it has table called "customers" and you are using default configuration such as

user = 'user'
password = 'user'
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 35432

[source,javascript]
.*Simple Access Example*

    const { Client } = require('pg')
    const client = new Client({
        user: 'user',
        host: 'localhost',
        database: 'northwind',
        password: 'secretpassword',
        port: 35432,
    })
    client.connect()
    
    client.query('SELECT CustomerID, ContactName, ContactTitle FROM Customers', (err, res) => {
        console.log(err, res)
        client.end()
    })
