= QGIS Integration

link:http://www.qgis.org/[QGIS] is an open source geospatial platform.  It can be integrated with {{ book.productnameFull }} to serve geospatial
 data from a variety of sources.

[id="client-dev-QGIS_Integration-Prerequisites"]
== Prerequisites

- Have QGIS installed.  {{ book.productnameFull }} integration was last tested with version 2.14. 

- Your {{ book.productnameFull }} installation should already be setup for link:../admin/Socket_Transports.adoc[ODBC] access.  This allows the built-in compatibility of QGIS 
for PostGIS/PostgreSQL to be used.

- Have a VDB deployed that exposes one or more tables containing an appropriate Geometry column.
.. The {{ book.productnameFull }} system table link:../reference/sys_schema.adoc[GEOMETY_COLUMNS] will be used by QGIS.  Please ensure that the relevant 
geometry columns have the appropriate srid and coord_dimensions, which may require setting the {http://www.teiid.org/translator/spatial/2015}srid and {http://www.teiid.org/translator/spatial/2015}coord_dimension
extension property on the geometry column. 

[id="client-dev-QGIS_Integration-QGIS-Configuration"]
== QGIS Configuration

This process will need to be repeated for each VDB schema you are exposing that contains geospatial data.

. In the QGIS GUI browser panel right click on PostGIS and select "New Connection". 
. Fill in the {{ book.productnameFull }} server host, ODBC port, database (VDB Name with optional version), user, and password.
.. If your VDBs contain target schema or table names with % or _, {{ book.productnameFull }} must be configured to use the same default like escape 
character '\' as PostgreSQL to properly respond to metadata queries.  Either the link:../admin/System_Properties.adoc[system property] 
org.teiid.backslashDefaultMatchEscape must be set to true.
. Follow the typical QGIS instructions for creating a Layer by browsing to the appropriate schema and selecting a table that exposes a geometry.

[id="client-dev-QGIS_Integration-Additional-Considerations"]
== Additional Considerations

- If you are integrating a PostgreSQL source, you must not re-expose the postgres system tables including the PostGIS geometry_columns or geography_columns tables.
This is because QGIS makes unqualified references to these tables, which may then be ambiguous.
- Operations involving creating or deleting schemas or tables will not work.
- The logs might contain messages related to information_schema.tables - this is to determine if the qgis_editor_widget_styles table exists. {{ book.productnameFull}} is not compatible with QGIS editor widget styles.
